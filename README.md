# Magic 8 Ball

This program recreates the classic Magic 8 Ball game. Ask the Magic 8 Ball a question, and it'll give you a response from its predetermined list of answers.

## How It Works

The user is prompted to ask a question via the `input` function. Then, the code selects a random integer between 0 and 8 with the `random.randint` function. This integer corresponds to an answer in the `answers` list, which the code then prints out.

## Running the Program

To run the program, you can use any Python 3 environment. Enter your question when prompted, then press Enter. The Magic 8 Ball's response will print out below.

## Issues
